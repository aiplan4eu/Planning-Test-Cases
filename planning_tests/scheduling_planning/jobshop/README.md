# Job Shop scheduling problems

This module contains small Job Shop scheduling problems (4 jobs and 4 machines).

The `problems/` folder contains the problems with the optimal value, based on the makespan metric, and valid/invalid solutions.

The `.jsp` files contain additional sections compared to the standard version (the *Valid Plan* and *Invalid Plan* sections), which corresponds to the start time of each task for each job (for a valid or invalid plan respectively).
